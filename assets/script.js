PSEUDOCODE

PHASE 1:
When I enter a city into the value field of the form and submit,
    an eventlistener fires and the app fetches data from the API
    it will json the data in .then()s
    once I have the data accessable the next phase begins

PHASE2:
The data the I fetched will be posted into 2 different sections. Current day/info & the 5-day forecast
    to do this I will need to do a for loop. if index === 0 post in current. else post in 5 day. (actually need will need to look at the data i get from API for better judgement)
    I will need to do the 3 steps of adding to the DOM
    This should be plenty to work on for now.
